what is a nonprofit?

according to google: nonprofit is a shorthand for "nonprofit organization", where nonprofit is an adjective meaning "not making or conducted primarily to make a profit".

according to wikipedia(EDIT:which is actually quoting merriam-webster): An organization with the purpose of which is something other than profit.

nonprofit =! charity

the idea for this post actually started with hearing an episode of the amazing podcast called "econtalk", hosted by russ roberts, an economist residing at stanford's hoover instutution. 

the episode is called "palotta on charity and the culture of the non-profit sector" and features daniel palotta, the entrepreneur behind massive multi-day charitable events such as "3-day for the cure " or "AIDSride" LINK: http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2013/06/pallotta_on_cha.html

palotta is on the showing talking about his new book "uncharitable" and opening up the concepts he puts forward in it.

thoughts:
how can nonprofits economical value be calculated?

are nonprofits forced to actually destroy economical value as they are constrained by law and public opinion to act inefficently?

is it okay for a non-profit CEO to take in a huge salary?

does a student organization destroy value when it loses a % of its funds to learning lessons and accumulating experience? Or is the value generated from learning these lessons net-positive for the future?

or on the other hand: do some nonprofits operate more as businesses, taking full advantage of it's tax exemptions.

a nonprofit cannot maximize for the _organization's profit_ but it can still maximize its revenue and thus it's workers surplus.

--> nonprofit charity uses economical learnings to create an efficent organization that performs cleft surgery. Train local doctors in large amounts --> cost goes down, skill stays in local society + something already cheap like cleft surgery is easy to justify through looking at the total ultility for all involved. Cleft children are easily ostracized by others, thus increasing their risk of being a "non-performing asset" for a society.
