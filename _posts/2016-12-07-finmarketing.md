NOT RDONE

included in this piece are some statements i can use if im asked to promote finland to someone. this may or may not be true, but hey, its marketing what does it matter?

finnish people are humble - a few years back newsweek aggregated OECD statistics in multiple fields into one "country score" and it turned out finland had the no.1 spot. so ofcourse they spammed "finland no.1" on all press/social media streams. when some finns got wind of this, they checked the indivudal scores and aggregated them again: turns out finland is actually just no.2 - switzerland was the correct "winner". they contacted newsweek and insisted this be cleared. newsweek has responded in saying that their calculations are correct - there were no errors. yet this plays as to a testament of finnish humility: even when prized as a leader in multiple fields our humbleness causes us to question and fact check each story.
**tl:dr** - finland was proclaimed no.1 country in the world by a rigorous study, yet finns scrutinized the fact as they could not beleive its true.
